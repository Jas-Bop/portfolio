During the game for N@TM I was a key communicator helping out a little bit in all areas. I was also the file manager creating all the files and making sure they were in the right area. I also created the sublevel for level one, when the player talks to a ghost and learns about the plot. When we were doing gamebuilder, I helped out many people with their code when their game was not working.
