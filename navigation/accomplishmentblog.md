What I saw:
During the game for N@TM I was a key communicator helping out a little bit in all areas of the project. I made sure everyone knew what they were supposed to be doing and helped connect different parts of the gorup when we were owrking on the game .I was also the file managaer which meant I created all the files and made sure they were saved in the right places, and named the right way so that they would stay organized. This was importnant because our game had a lot of different moving parts, meaning something could be easily moved or accidently deleted, and cause many problems. 

What I did:
I also created half of the sublevel for level one, which is when the player talks to a ghost and learns about the plot of the game. I used Gamebuilder as the base to make the basics for the level, and then used Javascript to fill in the rest of the lacking parts. We also imported images from our artist to use as game pieces. We had a little bit of the problem with the dialogue not loading but after some time we managaed to fix it.

My teaching experience: 
When we were trying to get gamebuilder to work on our personal repos I helped out many people with their code. Most of them had either a corrupt error or their images were not loading so I directed them on what to do while letting them still figure out how to do it themselves when they asked for help. I also taught Data abstraction to the class, and many of them did not understand what to do. I helped out a lot of people during my time in CSSE 1 and in turn it also helped me understand better aswell.
